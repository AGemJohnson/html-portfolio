<h1>The Best Movies According to Gem</h1>
<h2>My top 3 favorite movies:</h2>

<hr />

<h3>The Color Purple</h3>
<p>This movie is a tear-jerking historical drama.</p>

<h3>Straight Outta Compton</h3>
<p>This is a documentary on an American rap group called NWA. It's my favorite because I am a fan of Eazy E.</p>

<h3>Titanic</h3>
<p>This movie depicts what happened on that faithful night when the Titanic sank. I love Jack and Rose fictional characters.</p>
